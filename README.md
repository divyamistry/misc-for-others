# misc-for-others
Contains code I've written for random little tasks, mostly for others.

* `named-networks-for-students.R` was created for someone trying to show different types of popular named networks (e.g. Barabasi, Watts-Strogatz, etc.). The script creates bunch of these networks and puts them in a CSV file as edgelists.
* `simple-bipartite-graphplot.R` was written for someone else to help them quickly visualize bipartite network. Details are at the beginning of code in comments.
